# Rimcoin

Rimcoin is intended to be an easy to use cryptocurrency, as well as being great for real world transactions. 

Rimcoin's advantages include:

* No transaction fees

Rimcoin has never and will never (in the official version of the currency) support transaction fees. When a miner finds a new token, and submits it, they get 1/1000000th of 1 RC. While that might not sound like a lot, it is very fast to find a token. (fractions of a fraction of a second)

* No complications

Rimcoin does not use digital signatures. Instead, you have a random 10 digit number. You must provide this number to the Rimcoin server in order to send money. This means it is very easy to send, as you don't need a 512 bit number just to send money, with a number that changes on each transaction. You simply need a 10 digit number. 

* Instant transactions

Rimcoin allows you to instantly send money. You do not have to wait 2.5 minutes or 10 minutes. It is immediately sent from your account to the reciever's account.
